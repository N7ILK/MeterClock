# MeterClock
ESP8266 clock with display on milliamp meters.

I used 1mA meters with 3k 1% resistors. Pin assignments are in the code.

Only certain pins work for PWM output as well as button inputs for adjusting GMT offset.

I used "MeterBasic" from http://tonnesoftware.com/ to create the meter scales. I'm including the PDFs - YMMV
